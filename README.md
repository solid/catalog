# Solid Resources Catalog

-- a listing of things useful to the Solid Community

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create and make public a comprehensive listing of people, organizations, products, services, and events useful to people wanting to learn about, use, create, or promote the Solid software ecosystyem.  It's focus is as much social as technical and will include categorization based on social issues and contexts related to any given resource. Data will be kept in RDF as described in this repo and can therefore be reused by multiple applications. The public view of the Catalog will be accessible from solidproject.org and the solidproject POD.

## Audience

The primary audience of the Solid Resources Catalog is potential adopters of Solid, funders, new and onboarding developers, end-users, and the general public at any level of technical knowledge. 


## Long Term Goals

There are currently a variety of places where information about Solid resources are summarized - the solidproject.org website, the Solid Forum, a variety of github repos and awesome lists.  Currently each of them have different input forms which are not coordinated. These venues for display of data will continue but the hope is that input and editing of data can be consolidated in the Catalog and then the venues can decide which data to display and how to display it.

While the catalog will start as a single hard-coded RDF document, a long-term goal is to eventually support aggregation of data from other sources.  Personal, organizational, and software client WebID profiles contain data relevant to the catalog.  We can encourage all resources to create ClientID or WebID profiles, or a "README.ttl" - its own catalog entry describing itself which can be imported to aggregating catalogs.

The task of cataloging resources is shared by most organizations so a long term goal of this project is to create reusable shapes which can be formalized into client-to-client specifications and to document the process of creating the catalog and using the shapes so that other organizations don't have to reinvent the wheel.

## Scope 

In order to limit the work of updating the catalog, records are designed to cover only the basics - what type of thing is it? what is it useful for? what is its name and brief description? who made it? what other things perform similar functions? what other things apply to the same social domain? how can I find out more?  The catalog record is not like a full WebID or ClientID profile or github README - it covers the basics and points to those types of documents for further details.

The questions regarding the structure of the catalog can benefit from community input.  Please add your ideas by submitting or contributing to issues in this repo and by sharing your ideas in the [Solid Practitioners matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#solid-practitioners:matrix.org).  Occassional meetings regarding the catalog will be announced there. Ping me (@jeff-zucker) if you have questions.

### Similar projects

[Solid Efforts](https://github.com/elf-pavlik/solid-efforts) is a project intended to support exploration of the links between various ongoing work, co-creating technological foundations for the Solid ecosystem. Although there are plans to eventually coordinate between the projects, at this point in time they are separate projects.  In contrast to the orientation toward end-users, new developers, and the general public of the Solid Resources Catalog, Solid Efforts has an audience of those with a well-developed sense of technical processes interested in the technical underpinnings and terchnical interconnections of the Solid ecosystem.

## Acknowledgements

The catalog was started by and is currently maintained by Jeff Zucker with the help of members of the [Solid Practitioners](https://github.com/solid-contrib/practitioners).  Jesse Wright Elf Pavlik, and Daniel Bakas have contributed to the ongoing work defining shapes.  Timea Turdean, Matthias Evering, and Denis Shilov gathered some of the data which forms the basis for the catalog.  Thanks to all for their contributions.
